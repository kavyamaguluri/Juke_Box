# Juke_Box
In the JukeBox project, algorithmic thinking was applied in the song search feature using prefix matching to efficiently find songs, and in listing the top 10 most played songs by implementing a sorting algorithm to organize songs by play count. These enhancements improved performance and user experience in handling large song collections.
